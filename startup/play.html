        Eldrond had barely finished stepping both feet inside the dungeon when
        <b>WHAM!</b> the gate slammed down behind him.<br />
        <!--This will be a call to the "here i am" database-->
        "<span>This doesn't look like Kansas anymore!</span>" exclaimed
        Eldrond.<br /><br />
        Eldrond looked around and found himself in a small musty room that was
        <!--This will be a call to the "room fill" database-->
        <span>filled with bugs</span>. He looked ahead and saw an archway, and
        inscripted above the arch were the following words: <br /><br /><i
          ><span
            >“It's easy to stand in the crowd but it takes courage to stand
            alone.” - Ghandi</span
          ></i
        >
        <!--This will be a call to an external API - Inspirational Quotes-->
        <br /><br />
        Feeling inspired, Eldron began his trek into the unknown. <br /><br /><b
          >Alice's Turn</b
        ><br /><br />
        <!--This will be a call to the "book titles" database-->
        As Elrond walked, his foot suddenly hit something small and hard. He
        looked down and... it was a book titled "<span
          >A Summary of Every Book Ever Written</span
        >".
        <!--This will be a call to the "exclamations" database-->
        <br /><br />"<span>Gadzooks!</span>" exclaimed Elrond. He sat on the
        floor and began to inspect its pages and before he knew it, he had read
        the whole thing!<br />

        <br /><b>+5 📖 Intelligence</b><br />

        <br /><br /><b>Bob's Turn</b><br /><br />

        Down a dark staircase, Elrond noticed a mysterious object glimmering in
        a hole in the rock on his left. Curious, He reached his hand in and
        pulled out...<br /><br />
        <!--This will be a call to the "clothing" database-->
        A luxirous top hat!<br /><br />Elrond tried the item on, noticed it was
        very fashionable, and satisfied, placed the clothing item back where he
        found it. Maybe his adventure was short-lived, but he felt that it
        somehow left a lasting mark on his appearance.<br /><br /><b
          >+300 💄 Intelligence</b
        ><br />
        <br /><br /><b>Seth's Turn</b><br /><br />
        After several hours of walking (and a few minutes of skipping) Elrond
        came across a well that looked so old, it was as if it would crumble to
        dust if he touched it. He noticed the bucket was close to the surface of
        the well and so he took a look inside. He could see what was inside! It
        was...<br /><br />
        <!--This will be a call to the "random item" database-->
        A mysterious potion of unknown consequence!<br /><br />Just barely able
        to reach it, Elrond grabbed the item and stuffed it into his inventory.
