      <h2>Elrond's Big Adventure</h2>
      <section id="Text Adventure">
        Eldrond had barely finished stepping both feet inside the dungeon when
        <b>WHAM!</b> the gate slammed down behind him.<br />
        "This doesn't look like Kansas anymore!" exclaimed Eldrond.<br /><br />
        Eldrond looked around and found himself in a small musty room that was
        filled with bugs. He looked ahead and saw an archway, and inscripted
        above the arch were the following words: <br /><br /><i
          >‚ÄúIt's easy to stand in the crowd but it takes courage to stand
          alone.‚Äù - Ghandi</i
        ><br /><br />
        Feeling inspired, Eldron began his trek into the unknown. <br /><br /><b
          >Alice's Turn</b
        ><br /><br />
        As Elrond walked, his foot suddenly hit something small and hard. He
        looked down and... it was a book titled "A Summary of Every Book Ever
        Written". <br /><br />"Gadzooks!" exclaimed Elrond. He sat on the floor
        and began to inspect its pages and before he knew it, he had read the
        whole thing!<br />

        <br /><br /><b>Bob's Turn</b><br /><br />

        Down a dark staircase, Elrond noticed a mysterious object glimmering in
        a hole in the rock on his left. Curious, He reached his hand in and
        pulled out...<br /><br />A luxirous top hat!<br /><br />Elrond tried the
        item on, noticed it was very fashionable, and satisfied, placed the
        clothing item back where he found it. Maybe his adventure was
        short-lived, but he felt that it somehow left a lasting mark on his
        appearance.<br /><br /><b>+300 üíÑ Intelligence</b><br />
        <br /><br /><b>Seth's Turn</b><br /><br />
        After several hours of walking (and a few minutes of skipping) Elrond
        came across a well that looked so old, it was as if it would crumble to
        dust if he touched it. He noticed the bucket was close to the surface of
        the well and so he took a look inside. He could see what was inside! It
        was...<br /><br />A mysterious potion of unknown consequence!<br /><br />Just
        barely able to reach it, Elrond grabbed the item and stuffed it into his
        inventory. <br /><br /><b>Mysterious Potion Obtained</b><br />
